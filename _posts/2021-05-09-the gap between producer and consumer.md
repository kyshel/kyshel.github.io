title:  The gap between producer and consumer
---

they say, producer produce value.

consumer consume it.

how to be a producer?

produce codes? make products?

imagine the world in the wild era.

the resource that u have  is water, sunshine, air, coal, ore, seeds.

what u can do is only make seeds to feed.

make iron, metal, copper from ore, produce tools, weapons.

with the tech develops, cars, plane, bot, space craft comes.

with the micro trick, chips, computers, phone comes out.

with the CS, software, games, cryptocurrency exhibit.

and world is in a harmony.

But, life is not harmony, decade span is not static, year is not fixed.

We see the currrent status, as dynamic view.

People die, child grow, adult suffers, girls deliver, planet disappear.

But what we can touch, we can handle, we can experience, participate, drown.

Is only NOW.

People change, that can not follow the initial mind as they see more, touched more, played more.

to gather the power from outside to inner, needs clear mind and dedicated actions.

We recognize the world, we find the rules, the law, the order. We make schedule, and we do the action.

It seems that man is robot in this scenario. U breath it, u find it, u go for it.

There is huge uncertain on the road.

What's the obstacles between initial recognize and final result.

Enviroment is vital. Human nature that seems like not positive seems like a big factor. And lucky they say takes a more big role.

Rebuild your enviroment, do not tell me U can not. Beat the human nature with more higher recognition  perspective.  Lucky is not the things that U think. It should be considered as probability with calculable patterns.

Take the pain, admit it, try to like it, and final rely on it.
