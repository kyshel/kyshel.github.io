title:  What is currency?

Currency is consensus.

Currency is only the thing that people take for trade.

Why gold is global currency. Cause it have direct value from itself. It can turn to jewelry. It can turn to wire in the specific demand. And it seems like there is not so much on this blue planet.

When massive gold appears, its concrete price will be collapse.

Why cryptocurrency has price? 

Cause the creator designed a method that everyone can dig it, as long as you have a computer. 

It's like some authority shouts: hi everyone! I find a treasure that hides in everyone's yards underground. It's not much as water. It's not less as there is only 1 moon in solar system. It has fixed quantity and grow with everyones' workload digging.

So get a spade and dig now! U do not have spade? Okay I have, U can buy from me.

And people belives it. Many people begin to dig it and they exchange it each other by the real commodity.

The quantity is public to humans. They all know the basic rule and trust it. 

There is no the third party to dissolve the value of it. Cause it's controled by everyones dig speed.

And Later, human is liberated from do the things by themselves.

They designed a PROGRAM to achieve all the things.

All your need to do  is buy a MONEY-PRINTing-MACHINE, that is the Graphic-Card.

You owns more card, with more power supply, then the velocity of printing is more quick.

It's really  a great creation in the 21st century!

And maybe a little absurd in it.

But as you grow and look ground, U will see more absurd events.

And that's also a law that the last post mentions, and that the world operates.
