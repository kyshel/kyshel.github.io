title:  What's the better life pattern?
---

Ok, guys, this post is not about technical, it's about life, it;s about existence.


# 1 the current status
For a long time, I have been in a new city for 3 years. 

There is a little time that I thought about the life styles. Is current live style match my expectations? 

It seems like, not a little. For the two years begin, I drown to work, and I also try to make something. But the uncountable trival takes my heart and brain very much. I have no more time to head up to see the star in the night. My shifu remind me inadvertently sometimes. But I miss them, and I immersed in fantastic food and skyscraper.

But suddenly, 3 years pass. What I have got, what I reserved, what I achieved. I am asking myself these days. It seems like not meet my requirement. 

# 2 the ideal status
What's my requirements. I am trying to sketch a paint for the ideal status.

A room? A car? A job that less than 10mins walk to go to?

The minimum satification I think is that there R  infrastructures around in 10 miles. If more,  some balance and some food in the dwelling.

And to dye the memory, the shelter needs an hostess. We support each back.

# 3 next move
Needs make some moves to make  the status different. 

- From quiet to wild.
- From static to hyperactive.
- From micro to vast.

Challenging the daily post updated for 1 month.

See your at the milestone.
