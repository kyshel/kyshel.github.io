# 1 What is deep learning ?
Deep Learning is a glossary of AI field.

I do not want to give directly definition here. Rather I want to introduce the origin of it and let you have perceptual understanding.

First, we need to know the Venn Graph among AI, ML, and DL.

AI contains others, and ML contains DL, DL takes the most little area in Venn Graph.

AI has a long history. It was born in 1950s. ML is an approach to take symbolic AI. DL was developed by successive layers of representations. 

The word 'DEEP' means not deeper understanding, it means the layers of model, or say depth of model.

Compared to shallow learning, DEEP LEARNING has these task well performanced:
- image classification
- speech recognition
- NLP

# 2 Prerequisite
Do you need concrete math basic or computer basics?

Not essential. ML do not needs pen or papers to calculate things like math or phyzics, it's more like engineering science.

All you need is a computer with Graphic Cards that suppport CUDA. We use Nvidia 1070Ti in follow posts.



# 3 Is it worth to dive in
Deep learning is simplicity, scalability, versatility and reusability. And is only has been in the spotlight for years that less than decade. And much progress can be predicted that come in the next few years.

Like the slogan said by last post, next decade, we define it, with AI tools.

Looking forward to witness the new era with you!
