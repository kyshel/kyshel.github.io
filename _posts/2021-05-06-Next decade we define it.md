Time passed  so fast.

Tech changes never so huge like these years.

We live in a new era, never happend in history, no matter the level of the civilization, the harmony of the world, the extreme pleasure feeling of the new things.

So for the next decade, R U ready to embrace it?

# 2 The business pattern
Demand and want DRIVES market.

The core norm here is find others problem, solve it by your product, service or solution.

And keep it sustainable until some magic happens.

In AI field, how to build a sustainable pattern? 

That's a challenge that we can forward together.

The next steps will always search this answer.
